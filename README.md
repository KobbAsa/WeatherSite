# About project

So, I decided to create a project that I think will be useful to many people. We all look at the weather for today and the following days to find out how to dress, what to do and so on. 
Closer to the point, I present to y'all my project, which will help you to know the weather, wind speed, humidity, air quality and other information in any corner of the world for today and the next 5 days.

# Features
`Current weather:` Get real-time weather data for the specified city, including temperature, description, wind speed, humidity, pressure, sunrise, sunset, and air quality.

`Five-day forecast:` Display a five-day forecast for the selected city, including the date, weather icon, temperature, and additional weather information.

`Search:` Enter the name of a city in the search bar to retrieve weather information for that location. Pressing Enter or clicking the search button will update the current weather and forecast accordingly.

`Favorites (list):` Add cities to the favorites list for quick access to their weather information. The list can be cleared to remove all saved cities.

`Time and Date Format:` Toggle between different time and date formats (e.g., 12-hour/24-hour format, DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY) to customize how the time and date are displayed.

`Temperate Unit:` Switch between metric (Celsius) and imperial (Fahrenheit) units to display temperature measurements in the desired format

`Feedback:` Users can leave  feedback about the application by filling out a form. The entered name and comment will be saved and displayed for future reference.

# Getting started

Currently, here is only one way to start a page - is to run it locally. But very soon I will add this site to the open access and everyone will be able to just follow the link in order to try out all the features of the page.

*To run Weather Page locally, follow next steps:*

`1. Clone repository.`

`2. Open the index.html in browser.`

`3. Now you can fully dive in the world of weather and look up weather for every city that you want.`

`4. Explore and enjoy!`

# Technologies Used
`HTML`

`CSS` 

`JavaScript`

`OpenWeatherMap API`

# Api Bugs

Unfortunately, I do not own a meteorological station, so I have to use API to obtain data. API, although not people, can sometimes be mistaken. Namely, it happens (but very rarely) that `the current weather in Celsius and Fahrenheit can vary` by a couple of degrees. Also, the `wind speed can change for a unknown reason` when requesting in different types of temperature.
But, I can confidently say that these are bugs of the data itself from the API.
